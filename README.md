I'm a passionate B.Tech Computer Science student with a knack for coding and a creative touch. Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I share my coding projects, explore new technologies, and occasionally dabble in graphic design.

## About Me
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
- ðŸŒ± I'm enthusiastic about software development and constantly learning new programming languages and tools.
- ðŸ“š I'm proficient in basics of Java and C, with experience in Flutter,MySQL, PHP, and moderate skills in HTML and CSS.
- ðŸŽ¨ I enjoy graphic designing using Photoshop,Blender and After Effects.Adding an artistic dimension to my projects.

## Projects
Here are a few projects I've worked on:

- [Netflix App](https://github.com/for-trancer/netflix_app): is a Flutter-based Netflix clone using the TMDB API to display real-time movie and TV show data. It features a BLoC-based architecture for state management, supports both light and dark themes, and is designed for adaptive viewing across different devices.
- [NEXUS](https://github.com/for-trancer/NEXUS): is an advanced version of my previous project ChatBox, developed using PHP, MySQL, and Python for face authentication. It offers real-time private messaging, customizable themes, and message translation capabilities.
- [Money Manager](https://github.com/for-trancer/money_manager): is my first Flutter app, designed to help users efficiently track their income, expenses, and manage custom financial categories
- [Note App](https://github.com/for-trancer/note_app): A simple Flutter application for creating, modifying, and removing notes. This app provides a user-friendly interface for efficient note management.
- [ChatBox](https://github.com/for-trancer/ChatBox): is an online messaging platform developed using PHP, AJAX, and MySQL. It provides a global chat section where users can interact with each other in real-time, as well as a personal messaging section for private conversations. The platform features secure user authentication, input validation to prevent common XSS attacks, and real-time message updates.
